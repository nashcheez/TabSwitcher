<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

-   Desktop view

[![Product Name Screen Shot Desktop][product-screenshot-1]](https://nashcheez.github.io/responsive-tabs/)

-   Mobile view

[![Product Name Screen Shot Mobile][product-screenshot-2]](https://nashcheez.github.io/responsive-tabs/)

Tabs are user interface elements that allow you to navigate between multiple documents in a single window. Regular implementations don't support responsiveness and tabs don't look polished on a mobile device. This plugin helps you to resolve that.

### Key Features

-   The Responsive Tabs application implements tabs with mutually exclusive content. Only one tab is active at a given time and the content corresponding to the active tab is only visible. Eg: http://liquidslider.com/

-   On mobile the tabs transform into a `<select>` drop down. The drop-down retains all the states from the desktop tabs and vice versa (e.g. The active tab becomes the selected option).

*   The app has an object oriented architecture implementing encapsulation and all the global variables & functions are attributed to a single `tabSwitcher` object in `generateTabs.js`.

-   The application developed here is fully responsive & the mobile view starts when the screen size is less than 769px.

### Built With

The application has been developed using HTML, CSS, JavaScript and jQuery.

For more information about jQuery, please visit the official docs.

-   [JQuery](https://jquery.com)
